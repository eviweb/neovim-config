## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `nvim-navic` (LSP-based breadcrumb) replaces archived `nvim-gps`; attached in LSP `on_attach` and rendered in lualine
- `neo-tree.nvim` (v3.x) replaces `nvim-tree.lua` as the file explorer
- Regression tests for LSP bootstrap, nvim-cmp mapping API, neo-tree migration, Trouble v3 keymaps, and Telescope extension loading

### Fixed
- `cmp.mapping.close()` replaced with `cmp.mapping.abort()` (current API)
- `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` cmp mappings now declare `{ 'i', 's' }` modes so LuaSnip jump works in select mode
- `require('nvim-navic')` in lualine config guarded with `pcall` to prevent crash when plugin is not yet installed
- Trouble keymaps migrated from v1 API (`workspace_diagnostics`, `document_diagnostics`, `quickfix`) to v3 (`diagnostics`, `qflist`)
- Telescope trouble integration updated from `open_with_trouble` to `trouble.sources.telescope` (v3 API), guarded with `pcall`
- Telescope `fzf` extension now explicitly loaded via `load_extension`
- Telescope `node_modules` extension load wrapped in `pcall` to tolerate missing build
- Bufferline offset filetype updated from `NvimTree` to `neo-tree`

### Removed
- `nvim-gps` (archived upstream, superseded by `nvim-navic`)
- `lsp-colors.nvim` (redundant with Neovim 0.9+ built-in diagnostic highlight groups)
- `lua/config/nvim-tree.lua` (replaced by `lua/config/neo-tree.lua`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `.editorconfig` with per-language indentation rules (Lua, shell, bats, Markdown)
- `LICENSE.md` (MIT)
- `tests/startup.bats` with static `require()` integrity checks for `init.lua`, `plugins.lua`, and `bootstrap.lua`
- Headless Neovim smoke tests for `init.lua`, `options.lua`, and `keymaps.lua`; skipped automatically under Snap, overridable with `NVIM_HEADLESS_TESTS_SKIP=0`
- Colored terminal output in `bin/nvim-config`: INFO (white), WARN (yellow), ERROR (red), DEBUG (cyan); respects `NO_COLOR` env var and TTY detection
- Supported platforms section in `README.md` (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Bash 5+, Neovim 0.9+)

### Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md` reformatted to Keep a Changelog with typed sections and bracketed version headers
- ERROR-level log messages now also written to stderr

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `bin/nvim-config` CLI with `install`, `--help`, `--version`, `--dry-run`, logging, and bash completion support
- `bats` test suite and a dedicated test runner under `tests/`

### Changed
- Replaced the old `install.sh` bootstrap script with `bin/nvim-config`
- Replaced the old `TODO` note with a structured roadmap in `TODO.md`

### Removed
- Exploratory Lua files that were not part of the runtime config
